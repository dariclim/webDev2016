    <p> You look around the subway station. No cops anywhere. Just a few people standing waiting for the train, and a homeless man sitting on the ground. <br> <br> Maybe it's ok this one time to jump the turnstile? You hop over. <br><br> The homeless man stands up, and takes off his costume. Underneath is a cop fully dressed in police uniform. He looks sternly over towards you. You freeze immediately, and gulp. <br><br> You just got caught.
