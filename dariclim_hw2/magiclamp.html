    <p>After several minutes of wasteful wandering around, you stop and ask yourself, wait a minute, did you even check your pockets for your phone or wallet? <br> <br> You fumble with the left pocket, nothing seems to be there. <br> <br> You check your right, nope, nothing in there. <br> <br> You feel around your back pockets, when you notice you feel something strange, an object uncomfortably wedged into your left back pocket. You whip the object out to look at it and alas! <br> <br> It's a Magic Lamp! Of course! How could you forget? <br> <br> You rub the lamp and a genie comes out. <br> <br> "Take me home," you say to the genie. <br> <br> The genie knocks you out and then you wake up home the next day. Congratulations, you made it home! </p>
