    <p> "Excuse me," you call out to a shadowed stranger standing across the street. "Could I ask where I am? I think I'm lost." <br> <br> The stranger doesn't seem to hear you. <br> <br> "I'm trying to get to 32nd street," you say while approaching closer to the stranger. <br> <br> Suddenly, he turns around and replies, <br> <br> "Maybe I can tell you the way, for a reward." You sigh. <br> <br>"I don't have my wallet on me or anything," you say. <br> <br> "Those shoes look nice," the stranger says while eyeing your shoes longingly.<br> <br> "Are you crazy?" you ask. "I'm not gonna give you my shoes, how will I walk home?" <br> <br>"Maybe just one shoe?" <br> <br>"One shoe?" you scoff. "You really think I would wanna hop my way home in one shoe instead?" <br> <br>The stranger loses interest and starts walking away. <br> <br>"Good luck staying lost," the stranger says. <br> <br>"Wait wait!" you say, and take a shoe off.<br> <br> "Here you go, one shoe, you can have it." The stranger takes the shoe happily. <br> <br>"Now will you tell me the way?"<br> <br>The stranger looks from his gaze and replies, "Uh yeah I have no idea where we are, mate." He bolts away with your one shoe in a hurry. Now you're lost, AND you have only one shoe.
